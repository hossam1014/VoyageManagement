# VoyageManagement

     Voyage Management is an innovative project that aims to streamline the process 
     of travel planning for users. Instead of relying on traditional travel agencies and 
     facing the hassle of manual reservations, this project provides a comprehensive 
     online portal for all travel-related needs. The following features/modules are 
     included:
     

# Pages
## User Module:
Users can register on the Voyage Management portal using a username and 
password.
Access to various facilities and services is granted upon login.
Users can book travel packages, reserve tickets, and make hotel reservations 
hassle-free.

## Reports Module:
This module is exclusive to administrators.
Administrators can generate different reports related to customer data, such as 
the number of portal users and reservations made through the portal.
These reports provide valuable insights for efficient management and decisionmaking.

## Distance Calculator:
The distance calculator feature helps users estimate the distance between their 
source and destination cities.
This information allows users to choose the most suitable travel option based on 
distance, such as car booking for short distances or train, or flight bookings for 
longer distances according to their budget.

## Currency Converter:
Designed to assist foreign visitors, the currency converter feature provides realtime currency conversion between their native currency and any currency else.
This ensures that visitors have a clear understanding of the value of their 
currency, preventing any potential deception or confusion.

## Summary:
Voyage Management simplifies the travel planning process by providing a userfriendly platform that eliminates the need for manual work and standing in 
queues. Users can conveniently access all necessary facilities, including package 
bookings, ticket reservations, hotel accommodations, and access to helpful 
resources. Administrators benefit from the reporting module, which provides 
valuable data for effective management. With the distance calculator and 
currency converter features, users can make informed decisions and avoid any 
potential inconveniences or fraudulent activities during their travels.

## Packages and it’s classes:

## Problems and it’s solutions:
1. It was hard to manage all the pages in one package, so we had to make 
several packages to organize the code as much as possible.
• It's good that you recognized the need for organizing the code into 
separate packages. This can help improve code maintainability and 
readability.
2. We had to find a way to communicate with each other so we could do our 
best, so we had to use GitHub.
• Using version control, like GitHub, is a great approach for 
collaboration and tracking changes in the project. It allows team 
members to work together efficiently.
3. Using GitHub was quite hard because of conflicts and our poor knowledge 
of it.
• Conflict resolution can be challenging when working with version 
control systems like Git and GitHub. It's important to have a good 
understanding of branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. 
Consider investing time in learning these concepts to make 
collaboration smoother.
4. We had to find a way to connect each page with other pages, so we 
searched for a way to do so and we found it.
• Establishing proper page navigation and connectivity is crucial for a 
smooth user experience. It's great that you explored and found a 
solution to connect the pages effectively.
5. We had to find a way to style the whole app, and we used CSS for it too.
• Using CSS for styling is a common and appropriate choice. It offers a 
wide range of customization options for the appearance of your 
application.
6. We wanted to use scene builder at first to make it easier, but it wasn't the 
right way to go, so we didn't continue it and started all over.
• It's important to evaluate different tools and frameworks before 
deciding on the best approach for your project. If scene builder didn't 
meet your requirements or wasn't suitable, it's wise to switch gears 
and explore alternative options.
7. The complexity of this project was a little bit harder because we had no 
reference to follow, and we started everything from scratch.
• Starting a project from scratch can indeed be challenging, especially 
without any reference or existing codebase to build upon. However, 
it can also offer creative freedom and opportunities for learning and 
innovation.

## Ways to improve the project:
• User Interface Optimization: Enhance the user interface for a seamless 
experience and address usability issues based on user feedback and testing.
• Personalization and Recommendations: Implement personalized 
recommendations based on user preferences and past bookings, allowing 
users to save favorites and create customized registration.
• Integrated more Booking System: Integrate with various travel service 
providers for a wide range of options, enabling real-time availability checks 
and instant booking confirmation with a unified payment gateway.
• Social Sharing and Reviews: Incorporate social sharing features for users to 
share travel plans and experiences, along with a review system for 
feedback and ratings to aid decision-making.
By implementing these improvements, the Voyage Management project can offer 
optimized user experience, personalized recommendations, efficient bookings, 
and enhanced social interactions.
